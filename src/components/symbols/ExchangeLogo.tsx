/**
 * Small round venue mark, corner-pinned on a symbol's asset icon the way
 * TradingView tags a search result with the exchange it comes from.
 *
 * Brand-coloured monograms drawn inline rather than the venues' own artwork:
 * a remote logo is one more image request per row (the search list renders up
 * to 100 at a time) and one more thing that can fail to load, and the colour
 * is what actually reads at 11px. Binance and Bybit share an initial, so they
 * are told apart by inverted palettes rather than by the letter.
