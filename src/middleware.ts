/**
 * Every matched request runs this middleware as its own serverless invocation,
 * *before* Vercel's CDN cache is consulted — so a matched path can never be
 * served purely from cache, no matter what `Cache-Control` its route sets.
 *
 * The public data proxies below serve identical, credential-free market data
 * to everyone and set long `Cache-Control` headers precisely so the CDN can
 * answer repeat hits without running any function. Excluding them here is what
 * actually makes that work; gating them behind auth bought nothing anyway,
 * since the data they return is public.
 *
 * `/api/trade/*` (minus exchange-info) deliberately stays matched: those
 * routes sign requests against a real exchange, and the session check keeps
 * the deployment from being used as an open proxy by a stranger.
