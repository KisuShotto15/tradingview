# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

@AGENTS.md

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Next.js dev server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build    # Production build (also runs the full TypeScript type-check)
npm run start    # Serve the production build
npm run lint     # ESLint (eslint.config.mjs, flat config)
npm test         # Unit tests (see below)
npm run test:watch
```

**Tests** run on Node's built-in runner (`node --test`) with **no extra dependencies** — the sandbox has no npm registry access, so Vitest/Jest can't be installed. Node 24 strips TypeScript natively; `test/register.mjs` (loaded via `--import`) registers a resolve hook for the `@/*` alias + extensionless imports and polyfills `localStorage` for Zustand `persist` stores. Assertions use a tiny Jest-style shim at [src/test-utils/expect.ts](src/test-utils/expect.ts) over `node:assert`. Tests live next to the code as `*.test.ts` and cover **pure logic only** (stores, indicators, drawing/alert math, sizing, formatting, symbol/exchange resolution) — no DOM/component rendering. Add a test: create `foo.test.ts` importing from `node:test` + `@/test-utils/expect`.

The `npm test` script bakes in the `src/**/*.test.ts` glob, so to scope a run, invoke node directly:

```bash
# One file
node --import ./test/register.mjs --disable-warning=MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON \
  --test --test-isolation=none src/lib/trading/sizing.test.ts

# One test/suite by name, across the suite
node --import ./test/register.mjs --disable-warning=MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON \
  --test --test-isolation=none --test-name-pattern="slInputToPrice" "src/**/*.test.ts"
```

`--test-isolation=none` is required (Zustand `persist` needs the shared polyfilled `localStorage`).

`next build` runs the full TypeScript type-check (`paths` alias `@/*` → `src/*`). Note **Next 16 removed ESLint from the build** — lint runs only via `npm run lint`, never blocks `next build`. The repo carries pre-existing `react-hooks` lint errors unrelated to most changes; don't treat a red `npm run lint` as a regression without checking whether your files are involved.

Requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `.env.local` (see `.env.example`). Without them, middleware auth and cloud sync fail. Market data needs no keys; private trading uses per-user keys entered in the UI.

**Note:** The `README.md` predates auth, drawings, and trading — treat this file and the code as the source of truth, not the README.

## Language

- All application UI strings are in **English**.
- Code comments and identifiers in English (consistent with UI).
- Commit messages and PR descriptions in **neutral Spanish** (no Argentine/Rioplatense slang: avoid "vos", "tenés", "querés", "andá", "che", etc.). Use "tú", "tienes", "quieres", "ve", "aquí".
- README and developer-facing docs can stay in Spanish (they're not part of the app UI).

## Architecture

Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui (Base UI primitives), Zustand for state, Supabase for auth + persistence, `lightweight-charts` v5 for rendering. **Everything client-side** except thin API routes.

### Symbol identity (read this before touching anything symbol-related)

A ticker string carries up to three pieces of meaning, and several bugs have come from conflating them:

- `BTCUSDT` — bare exchange symbol.
- `.P` suffix (`BTCUSDT.P`) — USDT-M **perpetual** rather than spot. `isPerp()`.
- `BYBIT:` prefix (`BYBIT:SOLUSDT.P`) — TradingView-style **exchange qualifier**, so a ticker listed on both venues can be charted from either. [src/lib/symbols/prefix.ts](src/lib/symbols/prefix.ts) is a dependency-free leaf module (imported by both low-level Binance helpers and the resolver, so it must not import them back).

`cleanSym()` in [src/lib/binance/rest.ts](src/lib/binance/rest.ts) strips **both** decorations to get the raw exchange symbol — that's what every exchange API call and every position/order match must use. `resolveSource()` decides which *data provider* serves the chart.

Consequence worth remembering: two different chart symbols (`SOLUSDT.P` and `BYBIT:SOLUSDT.P`) reduce to the same `cleanSym`, so matching an account position by symbol alone is not enough — see "Exchange gating" below.

### Data providers (multi-source)

`resolveSource(symbol)` in [src/lib/symbols/source.ts](src/lib/symbols/source.ts) classifies a ticker, and `fetchCandles()` in [src/lib/data/fetch.ts](src/lib/data/fetch.ts) dispatches on `src.kind`:

- **binance** — spot, or USDT-M perps, via `src/lib/binance/rest.ts` + live WebSocket (`ws.ts`).
- **bybit** — linear USDT perps via `src/lib/bybit/public.ts` (REST klines/tickers/instruments) + `src/lib/bybit/ws.ts` (live klines + tickers). Public data only; no credentials.
- **synthetic** — arithmetic expressions over symbols (spreads/dominance) via `src/lib/binance/synthetic.ts`.
- **yahoo / fred / coingecko** — stocks, indices, macro, market caps, proxied through `src/app/api/{yahoo,fred,coingecko}/route.ts` (these providers block CORS / need keys).

The symbol **catalog** ([src/lib/symbols/catalog.ts](src/lib/symbols/catalog.ts)) has a static half (curated stocks/indices/macro) and a **dynamic registry** populated at runtime: `useBybitSymbols` fetches Bybit's whole perp universe on app load and calls `registerDynamicEntries()` so those tickers resolve and appear in search. `resolveSource` also honours an explicit `BYBIT:` prefix *before* consulting the catalog, so a persisted Bybit symbol charts correctly right after a reload, before the registry has loaded.

When adding a data source: extend `ResolvedSource`, `SourceKind`, and the `switch` in both `resolveSource` and `fetchCandles`.

### Live data

Binance uses one multiplexed WebSocket (`src/lib/binance/ws.ts`) carrying `@kline_<interval>`, `@miniTicker` and `@bookTicker`. Bybit has its own (`src/lib/bybit/ws.ts`) exposing a deliberately **matching `subscribeKline` / `subscribeMiniTickers` shape**, so consumers pick a socket by source kind and otherwise treat them alike. Bybit requires a 20s heartbeat ping and sends ticker *deltas* (only changed fields), so its client retains last price/percent per topic, shared across every subscriber to that symbol. Both reconnect with exponential backoff. Non-crypto sources are REST-poll only.

`BybitWS.tickerSubs` fans a topic out to a **Set of listeners**, not a single callback — Bybit has no separate book-ticker stream, so `BuySellOverlay` reuses `subscribeMiniTickers` for its bid/ask quote on the currently-charted symbol, on top of whatever the watchlist already subscribed for that same symbol (Binance doesn't hit this: its `BuySellOverlay` quote uses `subscribeBookTicker`, a disjoint map). A single-entry map here silently drops whichever subscriber loses the race and orphans the topic when the other one unmounts — the watchlist row for the charted symbol goes stale until something forces a full resubscribe. Keep this fan-out shape if you touch this file; don't collapse it back to one listener per topic.

### Indicators

Pure TypeScript, computed client-side over the candle array on every update (`src/lib/indicators/`). `index.ts` has the primitives (`sma`, `ema` seeded with SMA, Wilder `rsi`, `macd`, `obv`); dedicated files hold the heavier custom studies (`adx.ts`, `squeeze.ts`, `vumanchu.ts`, `keylevels.ts`). Add a study: implement the calc, add its key to `IndicatorKey` + `IndicatorConfig`/`DEFAULT_CONFIG` in `chart-store.ts`, wire the toggle/settings dialog, and render its pane/overlay in `PriceChart.tsx`.

### State (Zustand stores, `src/lib/store/`)

- `chart-store.ts` — symbol, timeframe, indicators + config, colors/visual settings, watchlists, chart type, right-sidebar tab/width. `persist`ed to localStorage.
- `drawings-store.ts` — all chart drawings (see below).
- `trading-store.ts` — exchange choice, API credentials, orders, positions, balance, order form.
- `alerts-store.ts` — standalone price/RSI/MACD alerts (see "Alerts" below). `persist`ed to localStorage only — unlike drawing-attached alerts, these do **not** sync to Supabase.
- `mobile-store.ts` — mobile sheet/screen navigation.
- `replay/replay-store.ts` — bar-replay cursor/playback (session-only, not persisted).

Note `trading-store` keeps **two** position lists: `positions` (scoped to the chart's current symbol, drives the chart overlay and order panel) and `allPositions` (every open position on the account, refreshed regardless of which symbol is charted — used by the watchlist to badge any row, and by the bottom "Trading Account" panel so it isn't blank just because a different symbol is on the chart). `allPositions` is the one actually fetched over the network (`fetchAllPositions`, unscoped `/api/trade/positions`); `positions` is derived from it client-side via `syncPositionsFromAll(symbol)` — no second request. `fetchPositions(symbol)` (a real, scoped fetch) still exists for one-off post-action refreshes (after placing/closing/modifying), just not inside the polling loop.

Cross-cutting hooks are mounted once in [src/components/providers.tsx](src/components/providers.tsx): `useCloudSync`, `useDrawingsSync`, `useKeyboardShortcuts`, `useTradingSync`, `useBybitSymbols`. `useTradingSync` polls `/api/trade/*` every 2s **while the tab is visible** — every route it hits is a real Node.js Vercel Function (Fluid compute bills these), so it pauses entirely on `visibilitychange`/`document.hidden` and resumes with an immediate refresh on foreground, rather than polling a backgrounded tab all day.

### Undo/redo (unified history)

`src/lib/history/index.ts` defines a single `UnifiedHistoryStack` (`unifiedHistory`) recording three op kinds: `drawing`, `chartState` (indicator/config/visual changes), and `viewport`. Mutations that should be undoable go through it. Guard against re-recording during replay with `withoutHistory()` / `isApplyingHistory`. Note `src/lib/drawings/history.ts` also exists (drawing-specific); `src/lib/history/` is the newer unified layer.

### Drawing tools

All chart drawings (trendlines, fibs, rays, channels, long/short positions, horizontal/vertical lines, price/date ranges, rectangles, brush) live in `src/lib/drawings/` and `src/components/chart/drawings/`. They are:

- Rendered as an **SVG overlay** on top of lightweight-charts (`DrawingsLayer.tsx`), **not** via the Primitive API.
- Stored in `src/lib/store/drawings-store.ts`.
- Persisted to Supabase table `user_drawings` (one row per drawing, `data JSONB`, `kind` discriminator).
- Mutated only through actions that push to the undo/redo history.

The data model is a **discriminated union** by `kind`. All operations (render, hit-test, drag, serialize) `switch (drawing.kind)`. Coordinate ↔ price/time conversion helpers live in `src/lib/chart/coords.ts` and `snap.ts`; shared drag logic in `use-drag-point.ts` / `use-drag-shape.ts`.

### Alerts

Two independent mechanisms feed one evaluator:

- **Drawing-attached alerts** — the `.alert` field on `hline`/`hray`/`trendline`/`ray` drawings, synced to Supabase along with the rest of the drawing (see above).
- **Standalone alerts** (price / RSI / MACD) — `alerts-store.ts`, localStorage-only.

Both are evaluated together in [src/hooks/useAlertMonitor.ts](src/hooks/useAlertMonitor.ts), mounted **per-symbol inside `PriceChart`** (not globally in `providers.tsx`) and driven off the live last-price tick, so an alert only fires while its symbol's chart is open. Crossing detection (`conditionHit`/`priceLevelFor` in `src/lib/alerts/alert-eval.ts`) compares the previous vs current tick; sloped drawings (trend line / ray) are interpolated to the current bar's time so a moving price can cross a projected line. A 30s per-alert cooldown avoids duplicate toasts on a chattering price. Firing pushes to `alerts/toast-store.ts` (rendered by `AlertsToast.tsx`, mounted once in `providers.tsx`) and optionally plays a sound (`alerts/sound.ts`).

### Trading (live Binance + Bybit orders)

The user picks an exchange and enters API key/secret in the UI (`trading-store.ts`, persisted). Everything private goes through `src/app/api/trade/*`, which signs server-side and forwards to the venue. Credentials are passed per-request in the body/query — they are **not** stored server-side.

Each route takes an `exchange` param and dispatches: Binance is signed inline (HMAC-SHA256 over the query string), while Bybit lives in [src/lib/exchanges/bybit.ts](src/lib/exchanges/bybit.ts) (V5 scheme: `HMAC(timestamp + apiKey + recvWindow + payload)` with `X-BAPI-*` headers). That module also holds **pure mappers** normalizing Bybit responses to the shared `Order` / `Position` / `AssetBalance` shapes, which is where its tests live. Adding an exchange means extending `Exchange`, the per-route dispatch, and a mapper module.

Two venue differences leak into the shared model and are easy to get wrong:

- **TP/SL attachment.** Binance always expresses them as separate `reduceOnly` orders. Bybit stores them *on the position* (`takeProfit`/`stopLoss`): `placeOrder()` attaches them directly to a brand-new entry order's `/v5/order/create` call (`bybitPlaceOrder`'s `takeProfit`/`stopLoss` args) so the position gets its native TP/SL from the moment it opens, while editing an *already-open* position's TP/SL goes through the Bybit-only `/api/trade/trading-stop` route (`bybitSetTradingStop`) instead — two different Bybit endpoints for what looks like the same UI action, depending on whether a position exists yet. `Position` carries optional fields for both, and UI prefers the position's own values, falling back to matching reduceOnly orders (always for Binance; for Bybit only orders placed before this native-attach path existed). A position's stop can therefore surface twice (as a position field *and* an order) — the chart overlay deliberately skips orders a position already draws.
- **Hedge mode.** Bybit rejects orders whose `positionIdx` doesn't match the account's position mode (0 one-way, 1 hedge-long, 2 hedge-short). `Position.positionIdx` is plumbed through so TP/SL edits, closes, and new orders send the right index. Inferring hedge mode from *currently open* positions goes blind while flat (no positions ⇒ nothing to inspect) — `bybitIsHedgeMode()` (`/api/trade/position-mode`) queries `/v5/position/list` directly instead, since Bybit keeps returning a hedge-mode symbol's two dormant size-0 rows even with no position open.

`Position.percentage` is the true **ROI** (`unrealizedPnl / initialMargin`), not a naive price-delta × leverage estimate — those diverge, and even flip sign, once margin is added or the account is on cross. The chart's entry line intentionally shows *price movement* instead, matching TradingView; the positions table shows the ROI.

**Exchange gating:** account data always comes from the single connected exchange, but the chart may be showing a different venue's symbol. UI that overlays account state (chart order lines, watchlist position badges) must check `resolveSource(symbol).kind === tradingExchange` before rendering, or a Bybit position leaks onto a Binance chart of the same ticker.

Order sizing/risk math is pure and tested in [src/lib/trading/sizing.ts](src/lib/trading/sizing.ts). Canonical state is `qty` (base asset); every other display value is derived. Two distinct concepts share the word "risk" and must not be conflated: `SizingMode.RISK_USD`/`RISK_PCT` size the position *from* a risk budget and the stop distance, whereas `SlMode` only expresses *where* the stop sits (`PRICE` / `PCT_PRICE`). Risk is deliberately not an `SlMode`, since risk-on-both-sides is circular.

Per-symbol tick/lot precision (`pricePrecision`, `stepSize`, `minNotional`, …) comes from `useSymbolInfo()` ([src/lib/trading/symbol-info.ts](src/lib/trading/symbol-info.ts)), a client-cached wrapper around `/api/trade/exchange-info`. Anywhere a price gets rounded — a typed input, a bid/ask click, or a chart-line drag — must use this precision rather than a fixed decimal count: a hardcoded `.toFixed(2)` silently breaks sub-$1 symbols that need more decimals just to move the price at all.

Chart-side trading UI is in `src/components/trading/`. `OrderLinesLayer.tsx` draws entry/TP/SL/liquidation as an SVG overlay **plus** native lightweight-charts price lines — the native ones give the colored price-scale label and span the full pane (so a line continues past the SVG chip toolbar), and they're kept in sync with any in-progress drag so a dragged level doesn't leave a duplicate behind. Position TP/SL edits are two-step: drag → `pending` → explicit Confirm/Discard on the entry line before anything is sent. Right-clicking a position's TP/SL line opens a small menu ("Modify order…" / "Remove") instead — Modify calls `trading-store`'s `openPositionEdit()`, which stashes the position in `editingPosition` and switches the right sidebar / mobile shell to the Trade tab; `OrderPanel` renders `PositionEditPanel` (a typed price + ticks form) in place of the normal order form whenever that's set, so a price can be typed instead of dragged.

A working order's price/quantity can be edited either from the chart (drag its line) or from the Orders table ([src/components/layout/PositionsPanel.tsx](src/components/layout/PositionsPanel.tsx)'s edit popover) — both go through `modifyOrder()`, which cancels and re-posts with the given overrides since neither exchange supports an in-place amend. Leverage lives on the symbol/account, not the order, so editing it from that same popover calls `setLeverage()` separately and affects any future fill on that symbol, not just the order being edited.

### Chart snapshots

`chart.takeScreenshot()` only paints lightweight-charts' own canvas, so it would
drop every annotation — drawings and order lines are SVG overlays stacked on
top. `composeChartPng()` ([src/lib/chart/snapshot.ts](src/lib/chart/snapshot.ts))
composites the two, scaling the CSS-pixel overlays up to the canvas's
device-pixel size and inlining `var(--token)` colours (serialized SVG leaves the
document, so those would otherwise resolve to black). PriceChart registers the
capture through the same registry pattern as the viewport applier.

Snapshots upload to the **public** `snapshots` Storage bucket
(`supabase/migrations/04_snapshots.sql`) under a `<uid>/` prefix: writes are
owner-only via that prefix, reads are public because the point is a URL that
renders in an external journal. Clipboard image copy hands `ClipboardItem` the
*promise* rather than an awaited blob — Safari drops the user-gesture permission
across an `await`.

### Auth & cloud sync

`src/middleware.ts` (Supabase SSR) gates the whole app: unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login` (except `/login` and `/auth/*`). On sign-in, `useCloudSync` + `useDrawingsSync` load the user's chart settings, watchlist, and drawings from Supabase, then debounce-save changes back. Supabase clients: `client.ts` (browser), `server.ts` (route handlers / middleware). Schema + RLS policies in `supabase/schema.sql` and `supabase/migrations/`.

### Responsive shell

`src/app/page.tsx` branches on `useIsMobile()`: desktop renders the full sidebar/panel layout; mobile renders `MobileShell` (bottom-tab screens in `src/components/mobile/`). The dialog components are shared across both.

Mobile screens are being brought to feature parity with their desktop equivalents screen by screen (an ongoing effort — not every screen is there yet). The pattern: call the *same* Zustand store actions desktop uses (no parallel mobile-only state), reserve `mobile-store.ts` for navigation only (current tab, which fullscreen sheet is open), and reuse `MobileSheet` for anything desktop shows in a dropdown/popover/dialog. Only the *interaction* is touch-adapted, not the underlying behavior: desktop's native HTML5 drag-and-drop becomes a `setPointerCapture` + manual hit-testing implementation (touch browsers don't reliably fire `dragstart`/`drop`), and desktop's right-click context menu becomes a long-press (a `pointerdown` timer cancelled on `pointermove` past a small slop or on `pointerup`) opening the same actions in a sheet. A drag handle or a long-press target that sits inside a row with its own tap handler must call `stopPropagation()` on every pointer event it handles (down/move/up/cancel) — pointer capture keeps routing events to it, but they still bubble to the row's handlers unless stopped, so a button tap would otherwise also fire the row's tap-to-open. `WatchlistScreen.tsx` is the fullest example of this pattern so far. `TradeScreen.tsx` goes one step further and imports `matchTpSl`/`EditOrderPopover` directly from the desktop `PositionsPanel.tsx` (both exported for this) rather than reimplementing them — `EditOrderPopover` in particular needed no touch adaptation at all, since it's already a centered modal rather than a hover-dependent popover.

Some desktop-only pieces already work on mobile with zero extra code, because they're mounted inside components mobile already renders unchanged: `FloatingContextToolbar` (per-drawing delete/duplicate/lock/style) and the indicator pill row (hide/remove/settings, including per-instance EMA settings) both live inside `PriceChart.tsx`, which `ChartScreen.tsx` renders as-is; the indicator/chart-settings/drawing-settings/create-alert dialogs are mounted directly in `src/app/page.tsx`'s mobile branch alongside `MobileShell`, "reusing the desktop dialogs" per the comment there. Check for this kind of free reuse before porting a feature — `MobileDrawingsSheet.tsx` and `MobileIndicatorsSheet.tsx` only needed to add the *triggers* (favorite star, magnet/alert/clear rows, "add EMA") that desktop exposes via right-click or a sidebar button mobile has no equivalent gesture for; the tool catalog itself is imported from the desktop-owned `drawing-tools.ts` rather than duplicated, so a tool added there appears on mobile automatically.

Not every desktop panel is safe to reuse as-is, though: `AlertsPanel.tsx`'s edit/delete buttons are hover-revealed (`opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`), which never becomes visible on touch, so `MobileAlertsSheet.tsx` reimplements the same two lists (standalone + drawing-attached alerts) with always-visible actions instead of importing the panel directly — check whether a component's interactive affordances *depend* on hover before reusing it wholesale, not just whether its layout would fit. Its "+" (create alert) button calls the same `openAlertDialog()` a desktop right-click on the chart uses; `CreateAlertDialog` itself needed no changes since it's a centered modal, not a hover-dependent popover, and mobile's `page.tsx` branch already mounts it. Desktop's `ChartTypeSelector` and `SnapshotButton`, by contrast, *are* directly reusable — they're built on the shared `DropdownMenu` primitive (Base UI, tap-triggered and portal-rendered, so it doesn't clip against `ChartScreen.tsx`'s horizontally-scrolling toolbar) — `ChartScreen.tsx` imports both as-is. `TimeframeSelector` is the opposite case again: a hand-rolled `absolute`-positioned dropdown with its own hover-revealed favorite star, so `MobileTimeframeSheet.tsx` reimplements it as a fullscreen list instead. The lesson each time: check whether the desktop piece is built on the shared portal-based `DropdownMenu`/dialog primitives (safe to reuse) versus hand-rolled positioning or hover-only affordances (needs a mobile-specific rebuild) — don't assume either way from layout alone.

Known remaining gap: there's no mobile equivalent of the desktop "Objects" tab (`ObjectTreePanel.tsx`) for browsing/managing drawings as a list rather than tapping them on the canvas.

### Typography

The app leans heavily on very small arbitrary text sizes (`text-[9px]`…`text-[12px]`). [src/app/globals.css](src/app/globals.css) overrides these **globally**, enforcing an 11px floor, and also raises Tailwind's `--text-xs`/`--text-sm` tokens. The overrides are declared *unlayered* (outside `@layer`) so they beat Tailwind's generated utilities regardless of source order. So a `text-[10px]` in a component does not render at 10px — change the sizing scale there, not per-component, and verify against the compiled CSS.

SVG overlays (chart drawings, order lines) size text with the numeric `fontSize` attribute instead, which those CSS rules do **not** affect — they must be adjusted in the components themselves.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Centralized in `src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`. The chart-level handler is global (`window`), guarded against input elements.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Esc` | Cancel current placement → reset tool → deselect |
| `Ctrl+Z` / `Cmd+Z` | Undo |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` | Redo |
| `Del` / `Backspace` | Delete selected drawing |
| `←` `→` `↑` `↓` | Nudge selected drawing (`Shift` = 10x) |

Arrow nudging translates via the pure `translateDrawing()` (`src/lib/drawings/translate.ts`) and follows the drag convention — `updateLive` per keypress, one `commit` once the run settles — so holding a key doesn't spam history or the cloud. Vertical steps are one screen pixel, which the hook gets from a probe `PriceChart` registers in `src/lib/chart/nudge.ts` (same registry pattern as the viewport applier), since only the live chart knows the price-per-pixel scale.
